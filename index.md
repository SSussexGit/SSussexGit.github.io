# Projects I've Worked On

## Stitched Trajectories for Off-Policy Learning 

This work aims to reduce the variance of batch off-policy estimators by using the Markov property to construct new trajectories from those in the original dataset. This work began as a class project for Professor Susan Murphy's graduate seminar on sequential decision making. The project I presented at the end of the class is available here. I've continued working on this project since. It's a collaboration between myself, Omer Gottesman and Professor Finale Doshi-Velez, along with Yao Liu and Professor Emma Brunskill at Stanford. 

## Information Elicitation for Credit Services

I worked with Harvard graduate student Eric Mibuari on the problem of using community reports to forecast a borrower's probability of repaying a loan. We designed an incentive compatible mechanism to obtain reports from a borrower's social circle on the borrower's creditworthiness, and formulated a lenders optimization problem, where the lender seeks to maximize profits whilst varying the number of community members they seek reports from and the amount of cash incentives they are paid for reporting truthfully. This project was completed as part of Professor Yiling Chen's graduate seminar on topics at the interface of computer science and economics. 

## Political Leaning Prediction

I worked with three other Harvard undergraduates on building a model to forecast whether a voter leans Democrat or Republican, using a datset provided by BlueLabs. This project was done as part of Professor Mark Glickman's class on Generalized Linear Models. We came up with a highly interpretable model that also achieved one of the highest predictive accuracies in the class, and as a result our professor shared our work with BlueLabs. 

## Musical Accompaniment to Solo Translation via RNN Encoder-Decoder

This work was done as part of Professor Alexander Rush's graduate machine learning class. I worked with two other undergraduates on applying research in machine translation to the problem of music composition. We tested our model on the task of jazz music composition. In a human trial, subjects could not distinguish between a MIDI produced by our model compared to a MIDI of a transcription of pieces by famous jazz soloists.
